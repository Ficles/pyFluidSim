This Repository is a unrealistic fluid simulation written in python by me.
## Why
I started this project because I thought fluid simulations were interesting and wanted to try make one. The reason I used python was because I can not be bothered to learn another language properly (and I hate myself). This was inspired by [this](http://https://youtu.be/rSKMYc1CQHE "this") video
